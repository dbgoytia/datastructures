# Binary tree

The most basic implementations of a Binary tree are:

* Perfect binary tree
* Complete binary tree
* Degenerate binary tree


# Traversing the tree
## In-order traversal

Algorithm Inorder(tree)
1. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Inorder(left-subtree)
2. Visit the root.
3. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Inorder(right-subtree)

### Applications 
Not receiving the values in non-increasing order
